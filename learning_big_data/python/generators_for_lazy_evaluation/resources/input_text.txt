Bloom Filters is one of those data structures that you donâ€™t generally 
learn about in a typical data structures 101 class, but wish you had 
learnt once you know about them. Despite reading several articles on bloom 
filters I was still finding it hard to grasp the concepts until 
the last week when I decided to sit down and not get up until I get 
the hang of it. Below is an article where I attempt to explain what 
I understood in a clear way (hopefully) so that others can learn.
